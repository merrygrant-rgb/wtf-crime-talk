On March 24, 2013, Aliza Sherman walked into downtown Cleveland to meet her divorce attorney.

It was a Sunday afternoon. Broad daylight. Office buildings were open. People were nearby.

She was a nurse. A mother of four. She was in the middle of rebuilding her life.

She texted to confirm the meeting.

She waited outside the office building.

She never made it inside.

Security footage shows a hooded figure approach her. The interaction lasts only seconds. She is stabbed repeatedly and left on the sidewalk. The attacker walks away.

Aliza dies from her injuries.

Within minutes of the attack, something else happens.

Her attorney's office - the very office she was scheduled to enter - is set on fire.

Not hours later. Minutes.

The timing forces a question that has never fully gone away: was this random violence, or was it coordinated?

### The Attorney

Aliza was scheduled to meet her divorce lawyer, Gregory Moore, to sign paperwork related to her case. According to Moore, he texted her that he was running late.

While she waited outside the building, she was attacked.

Moore was questioned but never charged in connection with Aliza's murder.

Years later, in unrelated cases, Moore was charged with multiple felonies involving arson and insurance fraud tied to other property fires. He ultimately lost his law license.

Those later charges were not directly connected to Aliza's homicide.

But the existence of additional fire-related allegations changed how many people viewed the timeline.

### The Fire

Investigators confirmed that Moore's office sustained fire damage shortly after Aliza was attacked.

The fire destroyed materials inside the office.

The proximity in timing - murder and arson within minutes - is one of the most unsettling elements of the case.

Two events. Same location. Same afternoon.

The case remains unsolved.

### The Institutional Questions

This is where the case shifts from tragedy to institutional scrutiny.

Aliza did what she was supposed to do:

* She hired an attorney.
* She scheduled a meeting.
* She showed up during daylight hours.
* She followed the legal process.

She was not meeting a stranger in secret.\
She was not taking unnecessary risks.

She was handling a divorce through official channels.

And she was killed.

When a scheduled legal meeting ends in murder - and when associated records are damaged by fire within minutes - the burden on the system to provide answers becomes heavier.

More than a decade later, no one has been convicted.

Her family continues to seek resolution.

### Why This Case Still Matters

Unresolved cases are not rare.

But unresolved cases involving coordinated timing, professional power structures, and destroyed documents demand a different level of attention.

Daylight removes the excuse of darkness.

A scheduled meeting removes the excuse of chance.

Aliza Sherman was exactly where she had been told to be.

And someone knew that.

Until there are answers, the case remains not just a mystery - but a question about trust, accountability, and whether the system failed a woman who followed its rules.
