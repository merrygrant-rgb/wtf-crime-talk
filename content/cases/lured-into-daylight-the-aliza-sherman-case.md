## The Attorney

Gregory Moore was questioned but never charged in connection with Aliza's murder.

Years later, in an unrelated case, he would be charged with multiple felonies involving arson and insurance fraud tied to other property fires. He eventually lost his law license.

That history changes how we look at the timeline.

Because here is the core question:

**Was Aliza lured into daylight?**

- - -

## The Pattern of Vulnerability

Aliza did what women are told to do:

* She filed for divorce legally.
* She followed procedure.
* She scheduled a meeting with her attorney.
* She showed up where she was told to be.

She was not reckless.\
She was not careless.\
She was handling her life.

And someone knew exactly where she would be.

That is the part that unsettles people.

This was not a chance encounter.

This required:

* Knowledge of her location.
* Knowledge of her timing.
* A coordinated fire.
* A getaway plan.

That is planning.

## Institutional Failure

The case remains unsolved.

No one has been convicted.

And the uncomfortable truth is that when professional power structures intersect with criminal investigations, complexity increases. Influence matters. Narrative control matters.

Aliza's family has fought for years for renewed investigation and transparency.

When a murder happens in daylight, with surveillance footage, with a connected arson, and still no conviction - we have to ask:

Is it lack of evidence?

Or lack of will?

## The Mother Factor

Aliza was a mother of four.

Her children have grown up without answers.

Every true crime case involves a victim.

But when that victim is a mother meeting her lawyer to legally exit a marriage - it hits differently.

Because she was doing everything right.

And it still wasn't enough.

## The Larger Question

If someone can:

* Schedule you.
* Predict your arrival.
* Coordinate destruction of records.
* Walk away in daylight.

Then this isn't chaos.

It's orchestration.

And orchestration implies someone with access.

- - -

## Where the Case Stands

As of now:

* The murder remains unsolved.
* The arson remains deeply suspicious.
* The attorney has a criminal history unrelated to this specific homicide.
* The family continues to seek justice.

The case has received renewed attention in recent years as investigators revisit evidence and public pressure increases.

But pressure without resolution feels hollow.

## Closing Reflection

There is something uniquely chilling about daylight violence.

Night allows us to blame darkness.

Daylight removes excuses.

Aliza Sherman was not hiding. She was not reckless. She was not wandering into danger.

She was summoned.

And someone knew she would come.

That is what keeps this case from fading into background noise.

Until there are answers, it remains a question that refuses to go quiet:

Was she targeted because she trusted the process?

Or because someone understood exactly how to manipulate it?
