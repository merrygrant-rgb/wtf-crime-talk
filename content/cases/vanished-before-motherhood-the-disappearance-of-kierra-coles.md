On October 2, 2018, **Kierra Coles** left her apartment on Chicago's South Side.

She was 26 years old.\
She was a U.S. Postal Service worker.\
She was nine months pregnant.

She told her mother she wasn't feeling well that morning and planned to see her doctor before work.

She never made it to either place.

She has never been seen again.

## The Last Morning

Security footage shows Kierra leaving her apartment building in uniform.

She appears calm. Walking normally. No visible distress.

She was due to give birth within days.

Her car was later found parked near her home. Her purse and phone were inside.

No signs of forced entry.\
No public struggle.\
No confirmed sightings after that morning.

Just absence.

## A Mother Waiting for a Mother

There is something uniquely painful about this case.

Kierra wasn't just missing.

She was about to become a mother.

Her family wasn't just waiting for updates from investigators - they were preparing for a baby shower.

Her mother has spoken publicly about setting aside baby clothes that would never be worn.

That's where this case shifts from mystery to ache.

Because this wasn't a risky lifestyle or late-night disappearance.

This was a woman going to work.

In daylight.

Nine months pregnant.

## The Questions

Investigators have followed multiple leads over the years, including persons of interest, but no arrests have been made.

The FBI offered a reward. The case received media attention. Community searches were organized.

And still - no answers.

The timeline leaves investigators with troubling gaps:

* Why did she call off work that morning?
* Did someone know her routine?
* Was she intercepted?
* Was this personal, or opportunistic?

Without confirmed evidence, the silence grows heavier.

## Why This Case Endures

Missing persons cases often drift into statistics.

But Kierra's does not.

Because it represents two lives.

Because she was so close to something new.

Because she walked out the door in uniform, prepared to deliver mail - and deliver a child - within days.

Her disappearance forces a protective instinct in anyone who hears it.

Not outrage.

Not spectacle.

Just a quiet, persistent question:

How does a nine-month-pregnant woman vanish in her own neighborhood?

## The Ongoing Search

More than six years later, Kierra Coles remains missing.

Her family continues to ask for information.

Her son, who never had the chance to be born into the world she was preparing for him, remains part of her story.

The case is open.

And someone knows more than they've said.
